# Ideas

## 2 modes:

1. Progress Mode
    - Element will change to a blue background
    - Happens whenever the full div is clicked
    - No course will be locked, since it's possible (but rare) that someone already made it without the prerequisite
    - The possibility of adding a new class (coursing the subject) is being studied
    - Possible classes:
        - `finished` - When the course is finished
        - `unlocked` - When the course is already unlocked
2. Exploration Mode:
    - The prerequisites and courses it unlocks will have it's style changed
    - Happens whenever the mouse hoves over, or when clicks the "i" (info) button
    - Possible classes:
        - `active` - When the course is clicked and you want to see the prerequisites and the courses it unlocks
        - `required` - When the course is a prerequisite to the clicked one
        - `unlocks` - When the course is unlocked by the clicked course

## To Do :
